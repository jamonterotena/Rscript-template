# Rscript-template

Standard Rscript with shebang, header, code sections (install packages, parse arguments and main code) and session info printout.

Allows easy conversion to Quarto format to generate static reports with showing the code and output of the script.

The bash function comes very handy to copy the template anywhere in the path system to a new R script.
